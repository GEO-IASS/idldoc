Backward-compatibility issues
-----------------------------

* A comment block separated from a routine header by a blank line would be
  associated with the routine in IDLdoc 2.0, but is considered a file level
  comment in IDL 3.0. In particularly, param, keyword, and returns tags in
  that comment block would now generate warnings since they are routine level 
  comment tags in a file level comment.

* The "inherits" tag was obsoleted. Inherited classes are automatically
  found by IDLdoc.

* The ASSISTANT and PREFORMAT keywords to IDLDOC were obsoleted. The IDL
  Assistant is not likely to be supported much longer by IDL, so the 
  assistant format was not reimplemented for IDLdoc 3.0. With the 
  introduction of the IDL format and the ability to add further formats, the
  PREFORMAT was deemed unnecessary to reimplement.
