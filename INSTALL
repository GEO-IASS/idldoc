For ``.sav`` file installation, simply place the ``idldoc.sav`` file in the
``!path`` in one of the various manners (see IDL's online help for details on
how to do this).

For building your own IDLdoc from the ``src`` distribution or from the
Subversion repository, there are more requirements.

  1. Put the ``src`` directory and its subdirectories into the ``!path``.

  2. Put the ``src\cmdline_tools`` and ``src\dist_tools`` directories into the 
     ``!dlm_path``.

  3. On UNIX systems, build the binaries in the ``src\cmdline_tools`` and 
     ``src\dist_tools`` from the top-level directory by just doing::

        $ make all

     On Windows, the individual commands must be entered. From the 
     ``src\cmdline_tools``::

        IDL> mg_build_cmdline_tools

     From the ``src\dist_tools`` directory::

        IDL> mg_build_dist_tools
