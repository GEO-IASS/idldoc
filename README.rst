IDLdoc
======

IDLdoc generates nicely formatted API documentation directly from IDL source
code. If the documentation is kept close to the code itself is much more likely
to be kept up-to-date. As much as possible the documentation produced by IDLdoc
is generated directly from the source code, making IDLdoc useful even if there
are no specially formatted comments at all in the source code.
