Format for .pro files
---------------------

If the comment format and markup are specified for an individual file, they
must be specified on the first line of the .pro file with::

   ; docformat = 'format markup'

where `format` is one of `IDL`, `IDLdoc`, `rst` or `verbatim` and `markup` is 
one of `verbatim` or `rst`. This statement is case insensitive and whitespace is 
not significant.

Before any routine declaration, there can be an optional file comments section.
This is marked off by the usual ;+ and ;-. There must be a blank line after the
;- to indicate that the comments are for the file and not the routine following
it.
