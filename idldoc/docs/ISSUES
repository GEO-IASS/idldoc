Known issues
------------

* Search is not implemented yet.

  This is the only (known) outstanding issue right now.

* Complexity statistics are not implemented yet.

  Statistics has been pushed back to IDLdoc 3.1.

* The ASSISTANT keyword is obsolete now (and probably will be for the release).
  The IDL Assistant is only going to be around for a while longer, so it didn't
  seem worth it to reimplement assistant formatted output.
  
* Defining two classes in one file can lead to name conflicts.

  This issue should be OK now.

* The help is not complete yet.

  The help is "complete", though I'm sure it could use more thorough explanation
  and more examples.
