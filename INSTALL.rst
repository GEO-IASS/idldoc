For ``.sav`` file installation, simply place the ``idldoc.sav`` file in the
``!path`` in one of the various manners (see IDL's online help for details on
how to do this).

Getting IDLdoc from the the GitHub repository is only slightly harder:

  1. Get the git repo and its submodules with::

       $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:mgalloy/idldoc.git

  1. Put the ``src`` and ``lib`` directories and their subdirectories into your
     IDL ``!path`` in your favorite manner.
