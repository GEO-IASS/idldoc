# iTools Programming Notes #
############################

In this example, we explore how to make an application using iTool
compound widgets in conjunction with "traditional" IDL widgets.

If your application requires a small number of interface elements not
available in the standard interface, consider creating a user
interface panel rather than an entire custom user interface.

iTool compound widgets are not exactly like other IDL compound
widgets. They do not generate widget events, and you cannot get or set
their values using the WIDGET_CONTROL routine.

Write the class definition first to subclass from the iTool system and
state what components of the iTool UI to keep/discard. Next, write the
UI definition programs. Finally, write the iTool wrapper program.

iTool Object identifiers are used to identify an iTool with a
lightweight, platform-neutral token, in this case, a string.
