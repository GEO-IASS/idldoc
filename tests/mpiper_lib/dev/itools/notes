A UI Panel is a collection of user interface elements displayed in one
or more tabs located on the right, left, or bottom edge of an iTool
window. The UI panel interface makes it easy to attach a set of
controls chosen by the iTool developer to the standard iTool
interface.

Five steps.
<ol>
<li> UI panel definition module
<li> UI panel event handling module
<li> UI panel callback
<li> iTool launch routine that registers the UI panel
<li> iTool class definition
</ol>

It seems like there is no way to "embed" an iTool in a standard IDL
widget program. Instead, the widget program must be written from
scratch in the iTools system, with a custom UI.
