<h3>
Purpose
</h3>
IM_ENGINE is an application for displaying and processing images.

<h3>
Requirements
</h3>

<ol>
<li> The application is built in IDL using object-oriented programming
	 techniques
<li> The application has a user interface (UI) to display an image
<li> The UI has pull-down menus for display, file i/o and image
	 processing options, as well as other functionality 
<li> The programmer can choose to separate the data from the
	 UI (data are persistent, but not the UI)
<li> A dismissed UI can be restored 
<li> The interface shall have scroll bars to display images that are
	 larger than a set fraction of the screen size 
<li> Image processing operations can be added to the UI after it is
	 realized
<li> The application can display single or multiband images
<li> The application can display the histogram of the current image
<li> The application employs Object Graphics
<li> The application supports the recording and playback of macros
	(sets of operations)
<li> Recorded macros can be written to a file
<li> The application can be exported to an IDL <tt>.sav</tt> file for
	 use with the IDL Virtual Machine
<li> The source code for the application shall be documented with IDLdoc
<li> The application shall be unit tested
</ol>

<h3>
Optional Features
</h3>

<ul>
<li> Add <i>Open</i> and <i>Save</i> buttons to the <i>File</i>
	menu in the UI
<li> Display cursor location and pixel value in the status bar in the UI
<li> Add parameter-checking code to ensure input can be displayed and
	processed as an image
<li> Construct a method to unregister image processing operations,
	removing them from the UI 
<li> Design new image processing operations, e.g.:
	<ul>
	  <li> median filtering
	  <li> differentiation
	  <li> sharpening
	  <li> unsharp masking
	  <li> edge detection
	</ul>
<li> Display the histogram of each band in multiband images
<li> Position the histogram next the main display in the UI
<li> Allow the current image to be zoomed up/down with menu items and
	with keystrokes (+/-) in the draw area
</ul>
