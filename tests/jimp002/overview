<p>Here's another one.</p>

<p>Culex_TargetTaskDL inherits from Culex_DistributedTaskDL which inherits TaskDL.</p>

<pre>Parsing targettasks\culex_targettaskdl__define.pro...
CATCH: Unexpected keyword cleanup stack found on return.
Attempt to call undefined procedure/function: 'TASKDL__DEFINE'.</pre>

<p>The problem here is that I'm subclassing from a class (TaskDL) that's defined in a DLM that I don't have on Windows, only Linux.</p>

<p>This doesn't stop idldoc, though.  It keeps running after this message.</p>

<p>Looks like an old CREATE_STRUCT message that I thought was fixed in
6.2 is still popping up.  See CR 39897.</p>
